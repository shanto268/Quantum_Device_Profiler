# Quantum Devices Profiler

## Functionality Needed:

**At Zero Flux**

- [ ] Find Resonances through Interfacing with VNA
- [ ] Use `resonator_profiling.py` to fit the resonances and record the stats
- [ ] Take a Power Sweep with VNA and DA for each resonance and record the power at which the resonance goes non-linear and power required for 1 photon
- [ ] Check for flux tunability through VNA and SMU


- [ ] Take a flux sweep with VNA and SMU
- [ ] Fit the flux curve and extract parameters of interest

### Extra Functionality for NBR Devices:

- [ ] Check for QP trapping (i.e. Multiple Lorentzian peaks test)
- [ ] Power Sweep at finite flux
- [ ] Test for QP clearing using an LO, VNA and SMU (i.e. sharpening of resonance)

### Extra Functionality for Dissipator Devices:

### Extra Functionality for JPA:

### Extra Functionality for TWPA:
